# Markov-Chain-Story-Generator
Program/Libraries written in C# that creates a story using Markov chains  
This program creates stories using Markov Chains.
In addition to the program are a few data structure librarys I created to help make the Markov Chain story program  
In order to run this please download one of the text files to use with the program. 
The command line arguments format should be: "name of .txt file", desired length of Markov state, desired length of created story.  
Any sample story text file may be used. Try your own to see what kind of stories you are able to create!
